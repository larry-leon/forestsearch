\title{Prepare data for bootstrap forestsearch re-run}
\usage{
prepare_bootstrap_dataframes(df_original, df_bootstrap, confounders_to_drop)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_original}{Full original analysis data frame}

\item{df_bootstrap}{Bootstrap resample of analysis data}

\item{confounders_to_drop}{Character vector of confounder names}
}
\value{
List with:
\itemize{
\item df_analysis: Bootstrap data with confounders removed
\item df_predict: Original data with confounders removed
}
}
\description{
Removes confounders and treatment flag to force fresh variable selection
in each bootstrap iteration. This ensures the full bootstrap distribution
of variable importance and selection is captured.
}
\details{
By removing confounders from the bootstrap data, we force forestsearch
to re-run its full variable selection pipeline (GRF, LASSO, etc.) on
each bootstrap sample. This captures the distribution of variable
selection stability across resamples.
