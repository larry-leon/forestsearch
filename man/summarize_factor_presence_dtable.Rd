\title{Summarize Factor Presence Across Bootstrap Subgroups (Original)}
\usage{
summarize_factor_presence_dtable(results, maxk = 2, threshold = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{Data.table or data.frame. Bootstrap results with subgroup
characteristics containing columns like Pcons, M.1, M.2, etc.}

\item{maxk}{Integer. Maximum number of factors allowed (default: 2).
Determines how many M.* columns to examine.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Percentage threshold for including specific
definitions in the output (default: 20). Only factor definitions appearing
in at least this percentage of successful iterations are included.}
}
\value{
A list with three components:
\describe{
\item{base_factors}{Data.table with columns: Rank, Factor, Count, Percent.
Shows frequency of base factor names (e.g., "age", "bmi") across all positions.}
\item{specific_factors}{Data.table with columns: Rank, Base_Factor,
Factor_Definition, Count, Percent. Shows specific factor definitions
(e.g., "age <= 50") that appear >= threshold\%.}
\item{threshold}{Numeric. The threshold value used for filtering.}
}
}
\description{
Analyzes how often each individual factor appears in identified subgroups.
This is the original implementation that may encounter data.table ordering
errors when column names conflict with objects in the environment.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# May fail if Base_Factor or Count exist as objects
result <- summarize_factor_presence(bootstrap_results, maxk = 2)
