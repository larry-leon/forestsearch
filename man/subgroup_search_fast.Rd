\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric vector of outcome (e.g., time-to-event).}

\item{Event}{Numeric vector of event indicators (0/1).}

\item{Treat}{Numeric vector of treatment group indicators (0/1).}

\item{ID}{Optional vector of subject IDs.}

\item{Z}{Matrix or data frame of candidate subgroup factors (binary indicators).}

\item{n.min}{Integer. Minimum subgroup size.}

\item{d0.min}{Integer. Minimum number of events in control.}

\item{d1.min}{Integer. Minimum number of events in treatment.}

\item{hr.threshold}{Numeric. Hazard ratio threshold for subgroup selection.}

\item{max.minutes}{Numeric. Maximum minutes for search.}

\item{minp}{Numeric. Minimum prevalence rate for each factor.}

\item{rmin}{Integer. Minimum required reduction in sample size when adding a factor.}

\item{details}{Logical. Print details during execution.}

\item{maxk}{Integer. Maximum number of factors in a subgroup.}

\item{method}{Character. "coxph" or "glmnet" for Cox model fitting.}
}
\value{
List with found subgroups, maximum HR, search time, and configuration info.
}
\description{
Faster version of subgroup.search() that pre-computes common operations
and uses vectorized operations where possible. Supports glmnet for faster Cox fitting.
