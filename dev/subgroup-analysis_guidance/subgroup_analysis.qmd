# Part 1: Foundational Principles

## Purpose of Subgroup Analyses

Subgroup analyses assess treatment effects in specific patient subsets within a clinical trial, typically defined by:

- **Demographics:** Age, sex, race, ethnicity
- **Clinical characteristics:** Disease severity, stage, histology, comorbidities
- **Molecular markers:** PD-L1 expression, HRD status, genetic alterations
- **Geographic factors:** Region, study site
- **Baseline risk factors**

### Primary Goals

1. Identify heterogeneity in treatment effects across patient populations
2. Support regulatory decision-making and labeling
3. Inform clinical practice and individualized treatment decisions
4. Generate hypotheses for future research

## Three Categories of Subgroup Analyses

### Inferential Subgroup Analyses

- Pre-specified with adequate statistical power and alpha control
- Intended to establish efficacy in a specific subgroup
- Requires prospective planning for sample size and multiplicity control
- Used when differential effects are anticipated based on strong biological rationale

### Supportive Subgroup Analyses

- Pre-specified but not powered for formal hypothesis testing
- Descriptively assess consistency of treatment effects across subgroups
- Conducted after demonstrating significant effect in total population
- Help ensure broad applicability of findings

### Exploratory Subgroup Analyses

- May or may not be pre-specified
- Hypothesis-generating rather than confirmatory
- Provide insights into treatment mechanisms and biological characteristics
- Should be clearly labeled and interpreted with caution

---

# Part 2: Planning and Design

## Pre-specification Requirements

### Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan Must Include:

1. Clear definition of each subgroup with scientific/clinical rationale
2. Specification of subgroup variables and cut-points
3. Statistical methods including interaction tests
4. Plan for handling multiplicity
5. Distinction between inferential, supportive, and exploratory analyses

### Best Practices

- Limit subgroups to those with strong justification
- Base subgroup selection on biological plausibility or prior evidence
- Avoid data-driven post hoc subgroup definitions
- Document decision-making process transparently

## Sample Size and Power Considerations

### Key Challenges

- Trials are typically powered for overall population, not subgroups
- Time-to-event analyses depend on number of events, not just sample size
- Subgroups often lack adequate power for reliable inference
- Single pivotal trials don't allow replication of subgroup findings

### Strategies

1. If subgroup is critical, design trial with adequate power for that subgroup
2. Consider enrichment strategies when appropriate
3. Use hierarchical testing to split alpha between populations
4. Plan for adequate representation in key subgroups

## Statistical Methodology

### Interaction Testing

- Use formal tests for treatment-by-subgroup interaction
- Don't rely solely on within-subgroup comparisons
- Include interaction terms in regression models
- Report interaction p-values alongside subgroup-specific estimates

### Multiplicity Control

- Multiple testing increases Type I error risk
- Consider Bonferroni or other appropriate adjustments
- Use hierarchical testing when evaluating multiple subgroups
- Balance statistical rigor with clinical relevance

### Graphical Displays

- Use forest plots to visualize effects across subgroups
- Show confidence intervals for each subgroup estimate
- Display interaction p-values
- Include consistency assessments

# Part 3: FDA Case Examples and Regulatory Decisions

## Approvals in Total ITT Population Despite Subgroup Concerns

### Case 1: Nivolumab (CHECKMATE-057)

**Indication:** Second-line metastatic non-squamous NSCLC

**Trial Results:**

- ITT population: HR 0.73 (95% CI: 0.60-0.89), p <0.002
- PD-L1 <1% subgroup: HR 0.90 (95% CI: 0.66-1.24)
- ~10% objective response rate in PD-L1 <1% patients

**FDA Decision:** Approved for entire study population

**Rationale:**

- Exploratory subgroup analysis with limited power
- Missing PD-L1 data (22%)
- No evidence of harm in PD-L1 <1% subgroup
- Meaningful responses observed despite modest HR
- Subgroup details included in labeling for informed decision-making

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key Lesson
Lack of statistical significance in subgroup doesn't preclude approval when no harm is evident and some patients benefit.
:::

---

### Case 2: Pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE-042)

**Indication:** First-line advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 ≥1%

**Trial Results:**

- ITT (TPS ≥1%): HR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71-0.93), median OS improvement 4.6 months
- TPS 1-49% subgroup: HR 0.92 (95% CI: 0.77-1.11), median OS 13.4 vs 12.1 months
- TPS ≥50% subgroup: Greatest benefit

**FDA Decision:** Approved for all patients with TPS ≥1%

**Rationale:**

- Trial not powered for TPS 1-49% subgroup analysis
- Active control (chemotherapy) as comparator
- No detrimental effect on OS in lower expression subgroup
- Uncertainty exists but doesn't warrant restriction

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key Lesson
Modest effects in exploratory subgroups with active controls may support broad approval when no harm demonstrated.
:::

---

### Case 3: Margetuximab (SOPHIA)

**Indication:** Later-line HER2+ metastatic breast cancer

**Trial Results:**

- ITT: HR 0.76 (95% CI: 0.59-0.98) for PFS
- CD16A F/F or F/V: HR 0.68 (95% CI: 0.52-0.90)
- CD16A V/V: HR 1.78 (95% CI: 0.87-3.62) - trend favoring trastuzumab

**FDA Decision:** Approved for entire study population with post-marketing commitment

**Rationale:**

- No clear mechanistic basis for heterogeneity by CD16A allotypes
- Small V/V subgroup (69 of 536 patients)
- Imbalanced patient characteristics within V/V subgroup
- Post-marketing studies required for further characterization

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key Lesson
Exploratory subgroup findings require mechanistic justification and adequate sample size to restrict indication.
:::

---

## Approvals Restricted to Subgroups

### Case 4: Olaparib + Bevacizumab (PAOLA-1)

**Indication:** First-line maintenance for HRD+ advanced ovarian cancer

**Trial Results:**

- ITT: HR 0.59 (95% CI: 0.49-0.72), p <0.0001
- HRD-positive (66% of ITT): HR 0.33 (95% CI: 0.25-0.45)
- HRD-negative (34% of ITT): No PFS benefit, OS numerically favored control

**FDA Decision:** Restricted to HRD-positive population only

**Rationale:**

- Strong biological plausibility (PARP inhibitor mechanism in HRD tumors)
- Lack of efficacy evidence in HRD-negative patients
- Potential for harm suggested by OS trend
- Consistent data across multiple PARP inhibitors
- Well-defined biomarker with validated test

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Lesson
Restriction warranted when clear mechanistic rationale, lack of benefit, and potential harm in complementary subgroup.
:::

### Case 5: Eribulin (Study 309)

**Indication:** Unresectable or metastatic liposarcoma

**Trial Results:**

- ITT (liposarcoma 32%, leiomyosarcoma 68%): HR 0.75 (95% CI: 0.61-0.94)
- Liposarcoma subgroup: HR 0.51 (95% CI: 0.35-0.75)
- Leiomyosarcoma subgroup: HR 0.90 (95% CI: 0.69-1.18)

**FDA Decision:** Approved only for liposarcoma

**Rationale:**

- Pre-specified exploratory subgroup analysis showed strong differential effect
- Biological differences between sarcoma subtypes
- Consistent differential effects across secondary endpoints
- Effect in larger leiomyosarcoma subgroup insufficient

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Lesson
Substantial evidence may be limited to subgroup when biological differences support heterogeneity.
:::

---

### Case 6: Atezolizumab + Paclitaxel (IMpassion130)

**Indication:** PD-L1+ triple-negative breast cancer

**Trial Results:**

- ITT: HR 0.79 (95% CI: 0.68-0.92), median PFS 7.0 vs 5.5 months
- PD-L1+: HR 0.60 (95% CI: 0.48-0.77), median PFS 7.4 vs 4.8 months, OS HR 0.71

**FDA Decision:** Accelerated approval limited to PD-L1+ population

**Rationale:**

- Trial designed with formal testing in both ITT and PD-L1+ populations
- ITT benefit magnitude modest (1.5 months) creating uncertainty
- PD-L1+ subgroup showed greater PFS benefit (2.6 months)
- Favorable OS trend in PD-L1+ subgroup
- Alpha split justified focused approval

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Lesson
Pre-specified formal subgroup testing enables regulatory decision to focus on subgroup with more robust benefit.

# Part 7: Common Pitfalls and Solutions

## Pitfall 1: Data-Driven Subgroup Selection

**Problem:** Choosing subgroups after seeing data increases false positives

**Solution:** Pre-specify all subgroups in protocol with clear rationale

## Pitfall 2: Multiple Testing Without Adjustment

**Problem:** Examining many subgroups inflates Type I error

**Solution:** Apply appropriate multiplicity adjustments or label as exploratory

## Pitfall 3: Within-Group Comparisons Only

**Problem:** Comparing p-values between subgroups is misleading

**Solution:** Use formal interaction tests

## Pitfall 4: Overinterpretation of Small Subgroups

**Problem:** Small samples yield unreliable estimates with wide CIs

**Solution:** Acknowledge uncertainty; seek replication

## Pitfall 5: Ignoring Biological Plausibility

**Problem:** Spurious findings lack mechanistic basis

**Solution:** Integrate biological understanding into interpretation

## Pitfall 6: Selective Reporting

**Problem:** Publishing only positive subgroup findings distorts evidence

**Solution:** Report all pre-specified analyses regardless of results

## Pitfall 7: Overriding Main Results

**Problem:** Focusing on subgroup contradicting overall findings

**Solution:** Require strong, consistent, credible evidence before overriding main trial conclusions
