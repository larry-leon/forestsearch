## Purpose
The `forestsearch` function performs subgroup identification and consistency analysis for treatment effect heterogeneity in survival data. It supports LASSO-based dimension reduction, GRF-based variable selection, and flexible cut strategies. The function is designed to find subgroups where treatment effects differ, using a combination of machine learning and statistical methods.

## Key Features
- **Subgroup Identification:** Finds subgroups with differential treatment effects using combinations of confounders.
- **Variable Selection:** Supports LASSO (for dimension reduction), and Generalized Random Forests (GRF) for candidate cut selection.
- **Flexible Cut Strategies:** Allows for forced cuts (e.g., "age <= 65", "biomarker < 1%", "biomarker < 2%", ..., "biomarker < 10%", etc), median cuts, and quantile cut strategies.
- **Parallelization:** Supports parallel processing for efficiency.
- **Consistency Analysis:** Evaluates the consistency of identified subgroups across splits or bootstraps.
- **Handles RCT and Observational Data:** Can be used for both randomized controlled trials and observational studies.

## Main Arguments
- `df.analysis`: Data frame for analysis.
- `outcome.name`, `event.name`, `treat.name`, `id.name`: Variable names for outcome, event, treatment, and ID.
- `confounders.name`: Names of confounder variables.
- `parallel_args`: List for parallelization (plan, workers).
- `use_lasso`, `use_grf`: Logical; use LASSO or GRF for variable selection.
- `grf_res`, `grf_cuts`: Precomputed GRF results or cut expressions.
- `max_n_confounders`, `grf_depth`, `dmin.grf`, `frac.tau`: GRF and search parameters.
- `conf_force`, `defaultcut_names`, `cut_type`, `exclude_cuts`: Cut strategy options.
- `n.min`, `hr.threshold`, `hr.consistency`, `sg_focus`, `fs.splits`, `stop.threshold`, `pconsistency.threshold`: Subgroup search and consistency parameters.
- `details`: Logical; print details during execution.

## Key Steps in the Function
1. **Input Validation:** Checks for required columns and arguments.
2. **GRF Variable Selection:** If enabled, runs GRF to identify important variables and cut points.
3. **Feature Selection:** Optionally applies LASSO for dimension reduction.
4. **Subgroup Search:** Searches for subgroups using combinations of selected variables.
5. **Consistency Analysis:** Evaluates the stability and consistency of identified subgroups.
6. **Prediction Dataset:** Optionally generates a prediction dataset with recommended treatment flags.
7. **Output:** Returns a list with subgroup definitions, candidate/evaluated confounders, prediction datasets, GRF results, and consistency metrics.

## Output
A list containing:
- `grp.consistency`: Subgroup consistency results.
- `find.grps`: Subgroup search results.
- `confounders.candidate`: Candidate confounders.
- `confounders.evaluated`: Evaluated confounders.
- `df.est`, `df.predict`, `df.test`: Datasets with subgroup flags.
- `minutes_all`: Total minutes elapsed.
- `grf_res`: GRF results.
- `sg_focus`, `sg.harm`, `grf_cuts`, `prop_maxk`, `max_sg_est`, `grf_plot`, `args_call_all`: Various results and metadata.

## Typical Use Case
Used in clinical trial or observational study analysis to identify patient subgroups with different treatment effects, and to validate the stability of these findings via cross-validation or bootstrapping.

# Required R Packages for ForestSearch Analysis

1. **grf**
   - Generalized Random Forests for causal inference and subgroup identification.

2. **policytree**
   - Policy learning and tree-based subgroup identification.

3. **data.table**
   - Fast and memory-efficient data manipulation.

4. **randomForest**
   - Random forest algorithms for variable selection and prediction.

5. **survival**
   - Survival analysis, including Cox proportional hazards models.

6. **weightedSurv**
   - Weighted survival curves and related methods.

7. **future.apply**
   - Parallelization of apply functions using the future framework.

8. **foreach**
   - Looping construct for parallel execution.

## Usage Notes
- All packages should be installed before running the analysis.
- Some packages (e.g., `DiagrammeR`) are only needed for visualization and not for the core analysis.
- The function `ensure_packages()` in your code can be used to check and install missing packages automatically.


# Installing Required R Packages for ForestSearch Analysis

To run ForestSearch and its associated bootstrap/validation workflow, you need to install the following R packages:

- grf
- policytree
- data.table
- randomForest
- survival
- weightedSurv
- future.apply
- foreach
- doFuture
- doRNG
- DiagrammeR

You can install all these packages from CRAN using the following R code:

```r
# List of required packages
required_packages <- c(
  'grf', 'policytree', 'data.table', 'randomForest', 'survival',
  'future.apply', 'foreach', 'doFuture', 'doRNG', 'DiagrammeR'
)

# Install any packages that are not already installed
new_packages <- required_packages[!(required_packages %in% installed.packages()[,'Package'])]
if(length(new_packages)) install.packages(new_packages)

# Load all packages
lapply(required_packages, library, character.only = TRUE)

# For weightedSurv, at the time of this note, is only available on github

library(devtools)
install_github("larry-leon/weightedSurv")


```

**Notes:**
- You only need to run the installation code once per R environment.
- If you encounter any errors, make sure your R version is up to date and you have internet access.
- Some packages (e.g., `DiagrammeR`) are only needed for visualization and not for the core analysis.
